audio/obama1_chunk_1.wav|I am so proud of each and every one of you. We are here today because every single one of you stood tall and said, yes, we can, yes.
audio/obama1_chunk_2.wav|yes we can learn yes we can succeed you decided you would not be defined by where you come from but but by where you want to go right what you want to achieve
audio/obama1_chunk_3.wav|by the dreams you hope to fulfill. For we gather here tonight in times
audio/obama1_chunk_4.wav|When the very foundations of our lives, the old order has been shaken, the old ideas and institutions have crumbled, and a new generation is called upon to remake the world. And let me be clear when I say.
audio/obama1_chunk_5.wav|When I say young, I'm not just referring to the date of your birth certificate. I'm talking about an approach to life, a quality of mind, and a quality of heart. We need people like you to step up.
audio/obama1_chunk_6.wav|We need your daring, we need your enthusiasm, we need your energy, we need your imagination. A willingness to follow your passions, regardless of whether they lead to fortune and fame.
audio/obama1_chunk_7.wav|A willingness to question conventional wisdom and rethink old dogmas.
audio/obama1_chunk_8.wav|a lack of regard for all the traditional markers of status and prestige, and a commitment instead
audio/obama1_chunk_9.wav|to doing what's meaningful to you, what helps others, what makes a difference in this world. We're engaged in two wars and a struggle against terrorism. The threats of climate change
audio/obama1_chunk_10.wav|nuclear proliferation.
audio/obama1_chunk_11.wav|and pandemic defy national boundaries and easy solutions. For many of you, these challenges are also felt in more personal terms. Perhaps you're still looking for a job.
audio/obama1_chunk_12.wav|We're struggling to figure out what career path makes sense. Now, in the face of these challenges, it may be tempting to fall back on the formulas for success that have been peddled so frequently in recent years.
audio/obama1_chunk_13.wav|It goes something like this. We too often let the external, the material things serve as indicators that we're doing well, even though something inside us tells us that we're not doing our best.
audio/obama1_chunk_14.wav|that we're avoiding that which is hard but also necessary, that we're shrinking from, rather than rising to, the challenges of the age. And the thing is, in this new hyper-competitive age, none of us, none of us,
audio/obama1_chunk_15.wav|can afford to be complacent. That's true whatever profession you choose. Professors.
audio/obama1_chunk_16.wav|might earn the distinction of tenure, but that doesn't guarantee that they'll keep putting in the long hours and late nights and have the passion and the drive to be great educators.
audio/obama1_chunk_17.wav|The same principle is true in your personal life. Being a parent is not just a matter of paying the bills,
audio/obama1_chunk_18.wav|Doing the bare minimum, it's not just bringing a child into the world that matters, but the acts of love and sacrifice it takes to raise and educate that child and give them opportunity. I'm standing here as president,
audio/obama1_chunk_19.wav|because of the education that I received. I know it's not always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have challenges in your lives right now. I get it, I know what it's like.
audio/obama1_chunk_20.wav|My father left my family when I was two years old. And I was raised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills and wasn't always able to give us the things that other kids had. There were times when I missed having a father in my life.
audio/obama1_chunk_21.wav|There were times when I was lonely and I felt like I didn't fit in. So I wasn't always as focused as I should have been on school. And I did some things that I'm not proud of, and I got in more trouble than I should have. And my life could have easily taken
audio/obama1_chunk_22.wav|a turn for the worst. But my mother, my grandparents, they pushed me to excel. But I was lucky. I got a lot of second chances, and I had the opportunity to go to college and law school.
audio/obama1_chunk_23.wav|and follow my dreams. You can't let the past get you down. You have to let it motivate you. Everybody here has got a unique story like that to tell. Each of you knows what it took for you to get here.
audio/obama1_chunk_24.wav|But in reaching this milestone, there's a common lesson shared by every graduate in this hall. It's not where you are or what you are. It's who you are. Because life will throw some things at you.
audio/obama1_chunk_25.wav|The truth is not a single one of the graduates here today has had as easy, not a single one of you had anything handed to you on a silver platter. You had to work for it, you had to earn it.
audio/obama1_chunk_26.wav|Most of all, you had to believe in yourselves. Yes, you've always been underdogs. Nobody's handed you a thing. But that also means that whatever you accomplish in your life, you will have earned it.
audio/obama1_chunk_27.wav|Whatever rewards and joys you reap you'll appreciate them that much more because they will have come through your own sweat and tears. Products of your own effort and your own talents.
audio/obama1_chunk_28.wav|You've shown more grit and determination in your childhoods than a lot of adults ever will.
audio/obama1_chunk_29.wav|That's who you are. We need everyone to broaden their ideas about what is possible. We need parents, politicians, and the media to see how success is possible, how success is happening every day.
audio/obama1_chunk_30.wav|So that's why I came here today. Because if success can happen here,
audio/obama1_chunk_31.wav|You have everything you need to get started. You've got no excuses. You have no excuses not to change the world. Did you study business? Go start a company, or why not
audio/obama1_chunk_32.wav|Help a struggling non-for-profit find better, more effective ways to serve folks in need. You study nursing? Understaffed clinics and hospitals across this country are desperate for your help. You study education? Teach in a high-need school.
audio/obama1_chunk_33.wav|Where the kids really need you, give a chance to kids who can't, who can't get everything they need, maybe in their neighborhood, maybe not even their home, but we can't afford to give up on them. Prepare them to compete.
audio/obama1_chunk_34.wav|for any job anywhere in the world. You study engineering? Help us lead a green revolution, developing new sources of clean energy that will power our economy and preserve our planet.
audio/obama1_chunk_35.wav|Find somebody to be successful for. Raise their hopes. Rise to their needs. That's what's made a difference in our lives and it's gonna make an even greater difference
audio/obama1_chunk_36.wav|in your lives not just for your own success because we live in a new world now the hard road does not end here
audio/obama1_chunk_37.wav|Your journey has just begun. It won't protect you against every setback or challenge or mistake. You'll make some, I promise. You're gonna have to keep working hard. You're gonna have to keep pushing yourselves. And you'll find yourselves sometime in situations where
audio/obama1_chunk_38.wav|Folks, if they've had an easier time, they're a little bit ahead of you, and you're going to have to work harder than them. And you may be frustrated by that.
audio/obama1_chunk_39.wav|You may have setbacks and you may have failures, but you're not done, you're not even getting started.
audio/obama1_chunk_40.wav|And if you ever forget that, just look to history. Colonel Sanders didn't open up his first Kentucky Fried Chicken until he was in his 60s. Winston Churchill was dismissed as little more than a has-been who enjoyed scotch a little bit too much.
audio/obama1_chunk_41.wav|before he took over as Prime Minister and saw Great Britain through its finest hour. When you read a great story, or you learn about an important moment in history,
audio/obama1_chunk_42.wav|It helps you imagine what it would be like to walk in somebody else's shoes. To know their struggles. Each of them, at one point in their life, didn't have any title or much status to speak of. But they had passion.
audio/obama1_chunk_43.wav|a commitment to following that passion wherever it would lead and to working hard every step along the way but if you do push yourselves if you build on what you've already accomplished here then i couldn't be more confident about your future
audio/obama1_chunk_44.wav|I'm hopeful and I'm excited about what all of you can achieve. And I know that armed with the skills and experience and the love that you've gained, you're ready to make your mark on the world. So thank you. Thanks for inspiring me.
audio/obama1_chunk_45.wav|I know starting your careers in troubled times is a challenge, but it is also a privilege.
audio/obama1_chunk_46.wav|Because it's moments like these that force us to try harder, and dig deeper, and to discover gifts we never knew we had. To find the greatness that lies within each of us. So don't ever shy away from that endeavor.
audio/obama1_chunk_47.wav|I can promise that you will be the better for that continued effort. Congratulations. God bless you.
audio/obama2_chunk_1.wav|Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen, as I address this hall as President for the final time, let me recount
audio/obama2_chunk_2.wav|the progress that we've made these last eight years. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We've taken away terrorists' safe havens.
audio/obama2_chunk_3.wav|strengthened the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia
audio/obama2_chunk_4.wav|and end Latin America's longest war. And we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick,
audio/obama2_chunk_5.wav|power communities across Africa, and promote models of development rather than dependence. And we have made international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative
audio/obama2_chunk_6.wav|while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change. This is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people.
audio/obama2_chunk_7.wav|And it could not have happened had we not worked together. And yet, around the globe, we are seeing the same forces of global integration
audio/obama2_chunk_8.wav|have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order. We see it in the headlines every day.
audio/obama2_chunk_9.wav|Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security
audio/obama2_chunk_10.wav|Basic.
audio/obama2_chunk_11.wav|order has broken down. We see too many governments muzzling journalists and quashing dissent and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth.
audio/obama2_chunk_12.wav|Endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest.
audio/obama2_chunk_13.wav|the constraints placed on them by international law. And this is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War,
audio/obama2_chunk_14.wav|The world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. And yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease.
audio/obama2_chunk_15.wav|and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult, and tensions between nations become more
audio/obama2_chunk_16.wav|become more quick to surface. And so I believe that at this moment, we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration.
audio/obama2_chunk_17.wav|Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that
audio/obama2_chunk_18.wav|We must go forward and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights
audio/obama2_chunk_19.wav|and international law that we have forged
audio/obama2_chunk_20.wav|remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts, facts that all too often we forget
audio/obama2_chunk_21.wav|in the immediacy of current events. Here's the most important fact.
audio/obama2_chunk_22.wav|The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 percent of
audio/obama2_chunk_23.wav|to under 10 percent. That's unprecedented. And it's not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat.
audio/obama2_chunk_24.wav|Mothers don't die in childbirth. Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village,
audio/obama2_chunk_25.wav|On a single, handheld device, in medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we're experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry.
audio/obama2_chunk_26.wav|And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity
audio/obama2_chunk_27.wav|than at any time in human history. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders.
audio/obama2_chunk_28.wav|the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world
audio/obama2_chunk_29.wav|has nearly doubled in the last 25 years. In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people, no matter their gender or race or religion or disability.
audio/obama2_chunk_30.wav|or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people's expectations
audio/obama2_chunk_31.wav|for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars, that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon.
audio/obama2_chunk_32.wav|that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union, that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth. I say all this not to whitewash
audio/obama2_chunk_33.wav|the challenges we face, or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward.
audio/obama2_chunk_34.wav|and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress. In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that
audio/obama2_chunk_35.wav|The existing path to global integration requires a course correction, because too often those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations, have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic
audio/obama2_chunk_36.wav|and sectarian identities have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced in order to handle transnational challenges. And as these real problems have been neglected,
audio/obama2_chunk_37.wav|Alternative visions of the world have pressed forward, both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest. Religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect.
audio/obama2_chunk_38.wav|Aggressive nationalism. A crude populism, sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right, which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age
audio/obama2_chunk_39.wav|free of outside contamination. We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction.
audio/obama2_chunk_40.wav|among too many of our citizens.
audio/obama2_chunk_41.wav|I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term. But I do believe that these visions fail to recognize at a very basic level our common humanity.
audio/obama2_chunk_42.wav|Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and technology and telecommunications, together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain, makes it self-defeating, ultimately, for those who seek to reverse this progress.
audio/obama2_chunk_43.wav|Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.
audio/obama2_chunk_44.wav|cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions economic, political and cultural
audio/obama2_chunk_45.wav|that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint.
audio/obama2_chunk_46.wav|But let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together. It starts with making the global economy work better for all people, and not just for those at the top.
audio/obama2_chunk_47.wav|While open markets and capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with
audio/obama2_chunk_48.wav|Rapid progress in technology has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. And advanced economies like my own unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have
audio/obama2_chunk_49.wav|disappear. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power
audio/obama2_chunk_50.wav|to further undermine the position of workers. In developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed.
audio/obama2_chunk_51.wav|And the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade.
audio/obama2_chunk_52.wav|And meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable. Nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens and a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach
audio/obama2_chunk_53.wav|of effective oversight. A world in which 1 percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent,
audio/obama2_chunk_54.wav|will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a
audio/obama2_chunk_55.wav|see how the most privileged among us live, and the contrast between their own lives and others. Expectations rise, then, faster than governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice
audio/obama2_chunk_56.wav|undermine people's faith in the system. So how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box.
audio/obama2_chunk_57.wav|Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market-distorting subsidies, beggar-thy-neighbor policies, an over-reliance on natural resources instead of innovation,
audio/obama2_chunk_58.wav|These approaches will make us poor collectively, and they are more likely to lead to conflict. And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central
audio/obama2_chunk_59.wav|planned control of the economy is a dead end. But I do believe there is another path, one that fuels growth and innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success.
audio/obama2_chunk_60.wav|It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor.
audio/obama2_chunk_61.wav|And growth is broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people, their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business.
audio/obama2_chunk_62.wav|It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship, and allows them to take more risks, to look for a new job or start a new venture. These are the policies that I've pursued here in the United States, and with clear results.
audio/obama2_chunk_63.wav|American businesses have created now 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top 1 percent of Americans were capturing more than 90 percent of income growth, but today that's down to about half.
audio/obama2_chunk_64.wav|Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. And with further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I'm confident that such progress will continue.
audio/obama2_chunk_65.wav|So just as I've pursued these measures here at home, so has the United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism. Not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises
audio/obama2_chunk_66.wav|that can destroy it. That's why we've worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation. Because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within.
audio/obama2_chunk_67.wav|That's why we've pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption and tracking illicit dollars. Because markets create more jobs when they're fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe.
audio/obama2_chunk_68.wav|That's why we've worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise environmental standards, as we've done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the
audio/obama2_chunk_69.wav|are more broadly shared. And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, I believe advanced economies
audio/obama2_chunk_70.wav|still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It's difficult to spend on foreign assistance.
audio/obama2_chunk_71.wav|But I do not believe this is charity. For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq, we could support institutions so that fragile states don't collapse in the first place.
audio/obama2_chunk_72.wav|and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. And that's why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we don't act boldly,
audio/obama2_chunk_73.wav|The bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged, and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.
audio/obama2_chunk_74.wav|The Paris agreement gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition. And there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy. So for the wealthiest countries,
audio/obama2_chunk_75.wav|A green climate fund should only be the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies and then make these technologies accessible and affordable for poorer countries. And only then can we continue lifting all people
audio/obama2_chunk_76.wav|up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair. So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable.
audio/obama2_chunk_77.wav|And in the same way, we need models of governance
audio/obama2_chunk_78.wav|that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people. I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can or should impose our system of government on other countries.
audio/obama2_chunk_79.wav|But there appears to be a growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order.
audio/obama2_chunk_80.wav|An order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries, and the rule of law. I know that some countries which now recognize the power of free
audio/obama2_chunk_81.wav|still reject the model of free societies. And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the Cold War, because we've learned that
audio/obama2_chunk_82.wav|Liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out building accountable institutions is hard work, the work of generations. The gains are often fragile, sometimes
audio/obama2_chunk_83.wav|We take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics
audio/obama2_chunk_84.wav|Elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game. And so, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it's no surprise that some argue the future favors the strongman, a top-down model
audio/obama2_chunk_85.wav|rather than strong, democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe the road of true democracy remains the better path.
audio/obama2_chunk_86.wav|I believe that in the 21st century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up, because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent. Young people need a global education.
audio/obama2_chunk_87.wav|in order to thrive. Independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, ultimately expectations of people will not be met. Suppression of
audio/obama2_chunk_88.wav|and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths, permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad,
audio/obama2_chunk_89.wav|can lead to war. Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual and not the other way around is shaped by America's story. Our nation began
audio/obama2_chunk_90.wav|with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few, but because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize and march and protest and ultimately
audio/obama2_chunk_91.wav|Those ideals won out, opened doors for women and minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength.
audio/obama2_chunk_92.wav|That gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavor. That made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States. So, yes.
audio/obama2_chunk_93.wav|My views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that's taken place in countries as different as Japan and Chile, Indonesia,
audio/obama2_chunk_94.wav|Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake in Europe.
audio/obama2_chunk_95.wav|The progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale.
audio/obama2_chunk_96.wav|And they have no recourse.
audio/obama2_chunk_97.wav|They demanded change because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland – societies that were more liberal and democratic and open than their own.
audio/obama2_chunk_98.wav|So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That doesn't mean democracies are without flaws.
audio/obama2_chunk_99.wav|It does mean a lot.
audio/obama2_chunk_100.wav|that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens, not less. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics.
audio/obama2_chunk_101.wav|Too much entrenched partisanship. Too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that
audio/obama2_chunk_102.wav|makes it harder to vote. In Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push and pull of national politics. Too often, in capitals,
audio/obama2_chunk_103.wav|Decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. And so these are real problems. And as leaders of democratic governments make the case for democracy abroad,
audio/obama2_chunk_104.wav|We'd better strive harder to set a better example at home. Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by centuries of history and the circumstances of geography and the deeply held beliefs of its people.
audio/obama2_chunk_105.wav|So I recognize that traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what at the time was a radical idea, the idea of the liberty of individual human beings.
audio/obama2_chunk_106.wav|endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can save their lives.
audio/obama2_chunk_107.wav|I believe that spirit is universal. And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom and dignity, and the opportunity to control
audio/obama2_chunk_108.wav|lives. This leads me to the third thing we need to do. We must reject any forms of fundamentalism
audio/obama2_chunk_109.wav|or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity.
audio/obama2_chunk_110.wav|Instead, we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings. That's a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures. Trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge
audio/obama2_chunk_111.wav|and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Muhammad. In a world that lets women and women of color
audio/obama2_chunk_112.wav|left the age of empire behind. We see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history.
audio/obama2_chunk_113.wav|And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics and suggesting that somehow people who look different
audio/obama2_chunk_114.wav|are corrupting the character of our countries. There's no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions, from their religion, from their ethnicity.
audio/obama2_chunk_115.wav|from their sense of nationhood.
audio/obama2_chunk_116.wav|But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people
audio/obama2_chunk_117.wav|who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity,
audio/obama2_chunk_118.wav|then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small, we are too packed together for us to be able to resort
audio/obama2_chunk_119.wav|to those old ways of thinking. We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. There, so much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought legitimacy
audio/obama2_chunk_120.wav|And not because of policies or programs, but by resorting to persecuting political opposition or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places
audio/obama2_chunk_121.wav|Perversions of a great faith were tolerated. And these forces built up for years.
audio/obama2_chunk_122.wav|and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria's tragic civil war and the mindless medieval menace of ISIL. The mindset of sectarianism and extremism and bloodletting and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed.
audio/obama2_chunk_123.wav|And if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts.
audio/obama2_chunk_124.wav|And our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build, rather than to destroy. And there is a military component to that. It means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life.
audio/obama2_chunk_125.wav|But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there is no ultimate military victory to be won, we're going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement.
audio/obama2_chunk_126.wav|and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect. Across the region's conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity,
audio/obama2_chunk_127.wav|and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder. Because until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn. Countless human beings will suffer.
audio/obama2_chunk_128.wav|most of all in that region, but extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting
audio/obama2_chunk_129.wav|our own societies. And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely, religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance.
audio/obama2_chunk_130.wav|Surely we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely we can rally our nations to solidarity while
audio/obama2_chunk_131.wav|equal treatment for all communities, whether it's a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians
audio/obama2_chunk_132.wav|will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel.
audio/obama2_chunk_133.wav|Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders,
audio/obama2_chunk_134.wav|in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us
audio/obama2_chunk_135.wav|to diminish others. This leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation
audio/obama2_chunk_136.wav|rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations. As President of the United States,
audio/obama2_chunk_137.wav|I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. And the end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth. I've noticed as President that,
audio/obama2_chunk_138.wav|and that at times both America's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were
audio/obama2_chunk_139.wav|by Washington or could be solved by Washington. And perhaps too many in Washington believe that as well. But I believe America
audio/obama2_chunk_140.wav|has been a rare superpower in human history, insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest. That while we've made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years,
audio/obama2_chunk_141.wav|And I've acknowledged some. We have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good. We have secured allies.
audio/obama2_chunk_142.wav|We've acted to protect the vulnerable. We've supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We've bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we've made mistakes, we've tried to acknowledge
audio/obama2_chunk_143.wav|We have worked to roll back poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders. I'm proud of that. But I also know that we can't
audio/obama2_chunk_144.wav|do this alone. And I believe that if we're to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity.
audio/obama2_chunk_145.wav|We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them. When Iran agrees to stop the spread of nuclear
audio/obama2_chunk_146.wav|to accept constraints on its nuclear program, that enhances global security and enhances Iran's ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb, that endangers all of us, and any country that breaks
audio/obama2_chunk_147.wav|this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment
audio/obama2_chunk_148.wav|to never test them again. We can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders, mosquitoes don't respect walls,
audio/obama2_chunk_149.wav|unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola. By strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop
audio/obama2_chunk_150.wav|of public health infrastructure. We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper.
audio/obama2_chunk_151.wav|Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children, including our girls, the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world.
audio/obama2_chunk_152.wav|But we have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution's founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own,
audio/obama2_chunk_153.wav|accept constraints. Sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms.
audio/obama2_chunk_154.wav|and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules
audio/obama2_chunk_155.wav|over the long term enhances our security. And I think that's not just true for us. If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. It may fuel nationalist fervor for a time.
audio/obama2_chunk_156.wav|Overtime, it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of
audio/obama2_chunk_157.wav|a few rocks and reefs. We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong.
audio/obama2_chunk_158.wav|And the good news is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we've accomplished here over the past few years. Together we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N.
audio/obama2_chunk_159.wav|making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together, we established an open government partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together,
audio/obama2_chunk_160.wav|Now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering.
audio/obama2_chunk_161.wav|I'll be discussing that more this afternoon. But we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard. Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and
audio/obama2_chunk_162.wav|who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love. We have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us.
audio/obama2_chunk_163.wav|And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect
audio/obama2_chunk_164.wav|accommodating these refugees. There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing. But many nations, particularly those blessed with wealth,
audio/obama2_chunk_165.wav|and the benefits of geography.
audio/obama2_chunk_166.wav|They can do more to offer a hand. Even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adopt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now
audio/obama2_chunk_167.wav|providing them a home. Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different story than the one that I've talked about here today.
audio/obama2_chunk_168.wav|There's a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries.
audio/obama2_chunk_169.wav|for most of history, have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes and ethnic groups and nation-states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate.
audio/obama2_chunk_170.wav|and not just
audio/obama2_chunk_171.wav|those ideas that bind them together. Time and again, human beings have believed that they've finally arrived at a period of enlightenment
audio/obama2_chunk_172.wav|only to repeat then cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human
audio/obama2_chunk_173.wav|human beings led to
audio/obama2_chunk_174.wav|repeated world war. But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations so
audio/obama2_chunk_175.wav|like that would never happen again. Each of us, as leaders, each nation,
audio/obama2_chunk_176.wav|can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose
audio/obama2_chunk_177.wav|a better history. Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability, it comes through the tireless efforts of men
audio/obama2_chunk_178.wav|willing to be coworkers with God. And during the course of these eight years, as I've traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people who are more
audio/obama2_chunk_179.wav|educated, and more tolerant, and more inclusive, and more diverse, and more creative than our generation, who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings.
audio/obama2_chunk_180.wav|than previous generations. And yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth, but it also comes with young people's access to information about other peoples and places. An understanding unique in human history that their future
audio/obama2_chunk_181.wav|is bound
audio/obama2_chunk_182.wav|with the faiths of other human beings on the other side of the world. I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who were now starting new businesses
audio/obama2_chunk_183.wav|The parliamentarians who used to be, just a few years ago, political prisoners in Myanmar. I think of the girls who have brave taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students
audio/obama2_chunk_184.wav|who started programs online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw strength from the young Americans, entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens who
audio/obama2_chunk_185.wav|remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions,
audio/obama2_chunk_186.wav|and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be. My own family is made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths.
audio/obama2_chunk_187.wav|from a lot of different parts of the world, just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore. And in my own life, in this country, and as President,
audio/obama2_chunk_188.wav|I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. That they don't have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty,
audio/obama2_chunk_189.wav|and equality and justice and fairness. The embrace of these principles as universal doesn't weaken my particular pride, my particular love for America. It strengthens it.
audio/obama2_chunk_190.wav|My belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn't lessen my commitment to help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination.
audio/obama2_chunk_191.wav|And to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can best look after my own daughters by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children and your daughters and your sons. This is what I believe.
audio/obama2_chunk_192.wav|that all of us can be coworkers with God. And our leadership and our governments and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth. Thank you very much.
audio/obama3_chunk_1.wav|Let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it,
audio/obama3_chunk_2.wav|my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely my father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in kenya he grew up herding goats went to school in a tin roof shack his father
audio/obama3_chunk_3.wav|My grandfather was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America.
audio/obama3_chunk_4.wav|that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world.
audio/obama3_chunk_5.wav|In Kansas, her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty.
audio/obama3_chunk_6.wav|joined Patton's army, marched across Europe,
audio/obama3_chunk_7.wav|Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and later moved west, all the way to Hawaii,
audio/obama3_chunk_8.wav|in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities
audio/obama3_chunk_9.wav|They would give me an African name, Barack, or Blessed, believing that in a tolerant America, your name is no barrier to success. They imagined me going to the best schools,
audio/obama3_chunk_10.wav|in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America, you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They're both passed away now. And yet I know that on this night they looked down
audio/obama3_chunk_11.wav|on me with great pride they stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage aware that my parents dreams live on in my two precious daughters I stand here knowing
audio/obama3_chunk_12.wav|that my story is part of the larger American story,
audio/obama3_chunk_13.wav|I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth
audio/obama3_chunk_14.wav|Is my story even possible? Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation.
audio/obama3_chunk_15.wav|Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be selfevident.
audio/obama3_chunk_16.wav|that all men are created equal.
audio/obama3_chunk_17.wav|that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that is the true genius of america a faith a faith in simple dreams
audio/obama3_chunk_18.wav|an insistence on small miracles that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm that we can say what we think write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door
audio/obama3_chunk_19.wav|that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe.
audio/obama3_chunk_20.wav|that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted
audio/obama3_chunk_21.wav|at least most of the time. This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against
audio/obama3_chunk_22.wav|a hard reality, and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebearers and the promise of future generations.
audio/obama3_chunk_23.wav|and fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, I say to you tonight, we have more work to do. More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois.
audio/obama3_chunk_24.wav|who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico.
audio/obama3_chunk_25.wav|And now we're having to compete with our own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. More to do for the father that I met who was losing
audio/obama3_chunk_26.wav|his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay 4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her,
audio/obama3_chunk_27.wav|who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college.
audio/obama3_chunk_28.wav|Now, don't get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead, and they want to.
audio/obama3_chunk_29.wav|Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any innercity neighborhood.
audio/obama3_chunk_30.wav|And folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know that parents have to teach that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations.
audio/obama3_chunk_31.wav|turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things. People don't expect
audio/obama3_chunk_32.wav|People don't expect government to solve all their problems, but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life.
audio/obama3_chunk_33.wav|and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better, and they want that choice. In this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best,
audio/obama3_chunk_34.wav|this country has to offer, and that man is John Kerry.
audio/obama3_chunk_35.wav|John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined
audio/obama3_chunk_36.wav|From his heroic service to Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor through two decades in the United States Senate, he's devoted himself to this country.
audio/obama3_chunk_37.wav|Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded,
audio/obama3_chunk_38.wav|So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home.
audio/obama3_chunk_39.wav|John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence
audio/obama3_chunk_40.wav|so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields john kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties
audio/obama3_chunk_41.wav|nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world,
audio/obama3_chunk_42.wav|War must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option. You know, a while back, a while back I met a young man named Seamus in a VFW hall in East Moline, Illinois.
audio/obama3_chunk_43.wav|He was a goodlooking kid, 6'2, 6'3, cleareyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And as I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country,
audio/obama3_chunk_44.wav|leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought, this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child. But then I asked myself, are we serving Seamus as well as he's serving us? I thought of the
audio/obama3_chunk_45.wav|men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors who won't be returning to their own hometown.
audio/obama3_chunk_46.wav|I thought of the families I'd met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked longterm health benefits because they were reservists.
audio/obama3_chunk_47.wav|When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they are going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to
audio/obama3_chunk_48.wav|and to never, ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.
audio/obama3_chunk_49.wav|Now, let me be clear, let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world.
audio/obama3_chunk_50.wav|These enemies must be found, they must be pursued, and they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this.
audio/obama3_chunk_51.wav|And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America.
audio/obama3_chunk_52.wav|And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga, a belief that we're all connected as one people.
audio/obama3_chunk_53.wav|If there is a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child.
audio/obama3_chunk_54.wav|If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent.
audio/obama3_chunk_55.wav|If there's an ArabAmerican family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It is that fundamental belief
audio/obama3_chunk_56.wav|It is that fundamental belief, I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper, that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams.
audio/obama3_chunk_57.wav|and yet still come together as one American family. E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. Now, even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us. The spin masters,
audio/obama3_chunk_58.wav|the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well
audio/obama3_chunk_59.wav|I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America.
audio/obama3_chunk_60.wav|There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America. The pundits.
audio/obama3_chunk_61.wav|The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking
audio/obama3_chunk_62.wav|poking around in our libraries in the red states.
audio/obama3_chunk_63.wav|We coached Little League in the blue states, and yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who oppose the war
audio/obama3_chunk_64.wav|who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the Stars and Stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.
audio/obama3_chunk_65.wav|In the end, in the end,
audio/obama3_chunk_66.wav|In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism, or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope.
audio/obama3_chunk_67.wav|John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it.
audio/obama3_chunk_68.wav|or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores.
audio/obama3_chunk_69.wav|The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta. The hope of a mill worker's son
audio/obama3_chunk_70.wav|who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.
audio/obama3_chunk_71.wav|Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face
audio/obama3_chunk_72.wav|of uncertainty, the audacity of hope,
audio/obama3_chunk_73.wav|In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen, a belief that there are better days ahead. I believe
audio/obama3_chunk_74.wav|can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.
audio/obama3_chunk_75.wav|I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair.
audio/obama3_chunk_76.wav|I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges
audio/obama3_chunk_77.wav|face us. America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no
audio/obama3_chunk_78.wav|have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine
audio/obama3_chunk_79.wav|The people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness.
audio/obama3_chunk_80.wav|a brighter day will come thank you very much everybody god bless you thank you
